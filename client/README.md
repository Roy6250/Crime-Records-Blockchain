This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Blockchain based Criminal Evidences Management System
### Introduction:
* Criminal records are highly sensitive public records. Tampering of criminal records is a criminal offence where a person alters, conceals, falsifies, or destroys evidence with the intent to interfere with an investigation by a law-enforcement, governmental, or regulatory authority.
* There are registered cases where the suspect/convict escapes tampering evidences, hence there is need of a reliable, fool proof system to maintain and manage crime records.
* By incorporating criminal records in a blockchain, authenticity and rigidity of records can be maintained, which also helps to keep the data safe from adversaries. 
* A peer to peer cloud network enables the decentralization of data. It helps prevent unlawful changes in the data.
### Idea:
* Our system presents ways in which the authority can maintain the records of criminals efficiently.
* Authorities (e.g., Law enforcement agencies and courts) will be able to add and access criminal data. 
* General users (e.g., selected organizations and/or individuals, airports, visa application centres etc.) can register themselves and will have access to the data so that they can look up criminal records. 
* Proper and timely access to authentic criminal records is essential to enforce the law. 
* The effect of corruption on the law enforcement forces will also decrease, as this will cut off an entire scope of corruption by removing any possibility of tampering with criminal records data.
### Technology Stack:
* Blockchain
    * Ethereum, 
    * Web3, 
    * Solidity,
    * IPFS,
    * Truffle.
* Front End (Web DApp)
    * React JS, 
    * Bootstrap.
* Back End
    * NodeJS.
* Database
    * MongoDB.
* Hosting Services
    * Heroku (React DApp),
    * MLAB (MongoDB),
    * Infura (Blockchain),
    * Metamask.
