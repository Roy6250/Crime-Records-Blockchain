## Blockchain based Criminal Evidences Management System
### Introduction:
* Criminal records are highly sensitive public records. Tampering of criminal records is a criminal offence where a person alters, conceals, falsifies, or destroys evidence with the intent to interfere with an investigation by a law-enforcement, governmental, or regulatory authority.
* There are registered cases where the suspect/convict escapes tampering evidences, hence there is need of a reliable, fool proof system to maintain and manage crime records.
* By incorporating criminal records in a blockchain, authenticity and rigidity of records can be maintained, which also helps to keep the data safe from adversaries. 
* A peer to peer cloud network enables the decentralization of data. It helps prevent unlawful changes in the data.
### Idea:
* Our system presents ways in which the authority can maintain the records of criminals efficiently.
* Authorities (e.g., Law enforcement agencies and courts) will be able to add and access criminal data. 
* General users (e.g., selected organizations and/or individuals, airports, visa application centres etc.) can register themselves and will have access to the data so that they can look up criminal records. 
* Proper and timely access to authentic criminal records is essential to enforce the law. 
* The effect of corruption on the law enforcement forces will also decrease, as this will cut off an entire scope of corruption by removing any possibility of tampering with criminal records data.
